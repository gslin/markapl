=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exports several useful functions that are meant to be used
inside templates.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item linklist($label1 => $url1, $label2 => $url2, ...)

Take pairs of labels and urls, return a structure like this:

    <ul>
      <li><a href="$url1">$label1</a></li>
      <li><a href="$url2">$label2</a></li>
      ...
    </ul>

=item cells($item1, $item2, ...)

Wrap C<< <td></td> >> tag around each item in the argument list.
Useful when showing tabular data. For example:

    table {
        while(my @data = $dbh->fetchrow_array) {
          cells(@data);
        }
    }

=item heads($item1, $item2, ...)

Similar to C<cells>, but output seris of C<< <th></th> >> tag instead.
For example:

    table {
        heads( qw(Name Age Gender Height Weight) );
        while(my @data = $dbh->fetchrow_array) {
          cells(@data);
        }
    }
